## Description

This weather dashboard provides dynamic, current information about weather conditions in U.S. cities.  When the user searches a U.S. city, weather data is pulled from a public weather API and displayed as current weather conditions and a five-day forecast.  

Users may submit searches by clicking the save button or by hitting "enter" on their keyboards.  Searches are saved onto local storage and reproduced below the search field for quick and easy access.
